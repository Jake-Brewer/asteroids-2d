Higher Cost: Priced at $2.00/M input tokens and $8.00/M output tokens (75% discount for cached inputs), it’s ~1.8x more expensive than o3-mini variants ($1.10/M input, $4.50/M output). A 10,000-word document (~13K tokens) costs ~$0.26 input and $1.04 output.
Slower for Reasoning Tasks: Lags behind o3-mini-high in deep reasoning (e.g., math, science), as it prioritizes instruction-following over iterative problem-solving. No specific reasoning benchmark scores are available, but it’s noted to “stumble” on long-term memory tasks like LongMemEval compared to o3-mini.
API-Only Access: Limited to developers, reducing accessibility for non-technical users compared to o3-mini’s availability in ChatGPT (free, Plus, Pro tiers).
Knowledge Cutoff: Limited to June 2024, potentially outdated for real-time queries compared to models with web access (e.g., Grok 3’s DeepSearch).
Key Metrics:

SWE-Bench Verified: 54.6% (coding)
MultiChallenge Improvement: 10.5% over GPT-4o
Context Window: 1M tokens
Cost: $2.00/M input, $8.00/M output
Latency: 95ms (comparable to o1 Pro)
2. o3-mini-medium
Pros:

STEM Optimization: Excels in math, science, and coding, with strong performance on AIME and GPQA Diamond benchmarks (exact scores not specified for medium variant but competitive with Grok 3’s 93.3% AIME and 84.6% GPQA).
Flexible Reasoning: Offers adjustable reasoning effort (low, medium, high), allowing users to balance speed and depth. Medium effort is ideal for tasks needing moderate analysis with low latency.
API Features: Supports function calling, structured outputs, and developer messages, making it developer-friendly for STEM applications.
ChatGPT Access: Available to free, Plus (150 messages/day), and Pro (unlimited) ChatGPT users, increasing accessibility compared to GPT-4.1’s API-only restriction.
Cons:

Smaller Context Window: 200K tokens is substantial but 5x smaller than GPT-4.1’s 1M, limiting its ability to handle massive documents or codebases.
No Vision Capabilities: Lacks image processing, restricting its use for multimodal tasks like UI design or visual analysis, where GPT-4.1 excels.
STEM Focus Limits Versatility: Optimized for technical tasks, it’s less effective for general-purpose needs (e.g., creative writing, broad conversation) compared to GPT-4.1.
Limited Benchmark Data: Specific scores for the medium variant are scarce, making direct comparisons challenging. It’s assumed to perform slightly below o3-mini-high.
Key Metrics:

AIME/GPQA: Competitive with top models (e.g., Grok 3’s 93.3% AIME, 84.6% GPQA) but exact scores unavailable
Context Window: 200K tokens
Cost: $1.10/M input, $4.50/M output

Deep Reasoning: High reasoning effort excels in logic-heavy STEM tasks (e.g., multi-step math, scientific analysis), outperforming GPT-4.1 in reasoning benchmarks like AIME and GPQA (specific scores unavailable but implied to exceed o3-mini-medium).
Cost-Efficient: Shares o3-mini’s pricing ($1.10/M input, $4.50/M output), offering high performance at ~1.8x lower cost than GPT-4.1.
API and ChatGPT Access: Available to Pro ChatGPT users (unlimited) and select API developers (tiers 3-5), balancing accessibility and advanced functionality.
Structured Outputs: Like o3-mini-medium, supports developer-friendly features (function calling, structured outputs), ideal for building STEM-focused applications.
Cons:

Slower Responses: High reasoning effort increases latency compared to o3-mini-medium and GPT-4.1, making it less suitable for time-sensitive tasks.
Smaller Context Window: 200K tokens, same as o3-mini-medium, is significantly smaller than GPT-4.1’s 1M, limiting long-context applications.
No Vision Capabilities: Like o3-mini-medium, it lacks image processing, reducing its utility for multimodal tasks.
Restricted Access: Limited to Pro ChatGPT users and select API tiers, less accessible than o3-mini-medium’s free-tier availability.
Data Loss in Long Contexts: Shows 18% data loss in long technical papers at 50K tokens, worse than Claude 3.7’s 88% accuracy at 200K tokens.

Critical Analysis
GPT-4.1 is the go-to for developers needing versatility, long-context processing, and multimodal capabilities. Its 1M-token window and image support make it ideal for enterprise apps, large-scale data analysis, and creative tasks. However, its higher cost and weaker reasoning compared to o3-mini-high limit its appeal for STEM-focused users. The API-only restriction also alienates non-technical users.
o3-mini-medium strikes a balance between cost, speed, and reasoning, making it suitable for STEM tasks where quick responses are needed (e.g., real-time math tutoring, code debugging). Its ChatGPT availability broadens its reach, but the 200K-token limit and lack of vision capabilities restrict its scope compared to GPT-4.1.
o3-mini-medium-high is the standout for coding and complex reasoning, with unmatched LiveBench scores and cost efficiency. It’s perfect for logic-heavy applications (e.g., algorithmic trading, scientific modeling), but its slower responses and long-context data loss (18% at 50K tokens) make it less practical for time-sensitive or massive-document tasks.
The narrative around these models often emphasizes benchmark supremacy, but real-world utility depends on use case. OpenAI’s marketing may overstate GPT-4.1’s versatility, while o3-mini’s STEM focus is narrower than advertised. Benchmarks like LiveBench and AIME are useful but don’t capture user experience nuances (e.g., GPT-4.1’s cleaner code output vs. o3-mini-high’s deeper logic).

Recommendations
Choose GPT-4.1 if you need: Long-context processing (e.g., analyzing massive codebases), multimodal tasks (e.g., UI design with images), or enterprise-grade instruction-following. Best for developers with budgets to support higher costs.
Choose o3-mini-medium if you need: Cost-efficient STEM solutions with fast responses (e.g., math problem-solving, quick code fixes). Ideal for students, educators, or developers on a budget.
Choose o3-mini-medium-high if you need: Top-tier coding and reasoning for complex STEM tasks (e.g., algorithmic challenges, scientific analysis). Best for advanced developers or researchers prioritizing logic over speed.
If you have a specific use case (e.g., coding vs. document analysis), I can tailor the comparison further. Would you like me to dive deeper into any aspect or provide a sample prompt to test these models?
