# Project Task Log: 2D Asteroids Game

This file tracks all major tasks, requirements, and next steps for the project, as discussed and agreed upon in our conversations.

---

## Core Objectives

- Develop a modular, maintainable 2D Asteroids-style game using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.
- Ensure high code quality using automated checks (ESLint, Prettier) and GitHub Actions workflows.
- Follow LLM-first design principles: small, focused classes and functions, well-documented code, and maintainability.

---

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Implemented the Ship entity with modular, LLM-optimized class design.
- [x] Added ESLint configuration for code style, complexity, and max lines.
- [x] Added Prettier configuration for code formatting.
- [x] Fixed initial ESLint/Prettier issues in codebase.
- [x] Set up GitHub Actions workflow to run ESLint and Prettier on push.

## In-Progress / Outstanding Tasks

- [ ] Debug/fix GitHub Actions workflow directory issues (ensure correct working directory, print debug info, etc.).
- [ ] Implement polling for GitHub Actions build status using EWMA-based interval.
- [ ] Announce build status (pass/fail) after each push and handle failures immediately.
- [ ] Maintain and update this task log as new requirements or tasks are discussed.
- [ ] Ensure all future code modifications adhere to modular, LLM-friendly principles.
- [ ] Keep documentation up to date with new features and project structure changes.
- [ ] Integrate additional ESLint plugins for complexity and size checks as next quality gate.
- [ ] (Optional) Automate syncing of tasks with GitHub Projects (new Projects experience) if/when API access is available.

---

## Next Steps

1. Ensure the GitHub Actions workflow passes the quality gates after the latest push.
2. Once CI is passing, proceed to add further ESLint plugins for complexity and size checks.
3. Continue modular implementation of other game entities and systems.
4. Update this log and project documentation as work progresses.
