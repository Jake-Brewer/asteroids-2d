# Asteroids 2D Game Design

## Overview

A modular, maintainable 2D Asteroids clone using vanilla JS and HTML5 Canvas. All code, documentation, and diagrams are kept in sync.

## Folder Structure

- `entities/`: Game objects (Ship, Asteroid, Bullet)
- `systems/`: Game logic (input, physics, collision, rendering, management)
- `utils/`: Shared helpers
- `docs/`: Documentation, diagrams, project tracking

## Principles

- Methods < 50 lines, files < 500 lines, folders < 12 items
- Each folder has a `contents.md`
- Commit early and often, push to GitHub
- CRC diagram and Kanban maintained

## Controls

- Arrow keys: Rotate/Thrust
- Space: Shoot

## Next Steps

- Implement Ship entity and InputSystem
- Expand project tracking as needed
