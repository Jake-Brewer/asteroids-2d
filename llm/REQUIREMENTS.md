        2.1.1- Modular, maintainable 2D Asteroids-style game using JS and HTML5 Canvas

        2.1.4- Atari-style visuals and gameplay for MVP
        2.1.5- Unit, integration, and UI tests (add especially after bugs)

        2.1.7- Task management: tasks.md until GitHub Projects is integrated
        2.1.8- All code, docs, and plans must remain in sync

        2.3.2- All code passes ESLint, Prettier, and CI checks
        2.3.3- All planned tasks completed (tasks.md and/or GitHub Projects)
        2.3.4- All code, docs, and plans are in sync
        2.3.5- Deployed and playable on GitHub Pages
        2.3.6- No critical bugs; all tests pass

    2.4- Requirements Management
